## 💡 Reflection

Understanding Flutter’s folder structure is important because it helps developers maintain clean, scalable, and organized applications. A well-structured project improves teamwork, reduces confusion, and increases development speed by separating platform-specific code from business logic.

By exploring folders like lib/, android/, ios/, web/, and configuration files such as pubspec.yaml, I gained a clearer understanding of how Flutter connects Dart code with native platforms.
